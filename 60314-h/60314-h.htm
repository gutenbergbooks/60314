<p>We are encouraged by the request for the renewal of the

already received. The price is 50 cents. We aim to secure
subscriptions sufficient to meet the cost of the magazine, and this
is a reminder to such of our readers as desire to assist us in
this object. We do what we can to make it worth the price asked.
Nearly all the articles it contains are written expressly for
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, and pains is taken to give variety and
freshness to each number.</p>

<p>Upon annual application, the following persons are entitled to
receive the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> free: life members,
ministers whose churches take an annual collection for the
Association, Superintendents of Sabbath Schools, and donors who
contribute in a year not less than five dollars.</p>

<h3 title="SOUTHERN M. E. CHURCH"></h3>

<p>We wish to congratulate the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church
on her growing helpfulness to the colored people. A recent and
most timely gift in this direction was that of Dr. Haygood, as the
agent for the disbursing of the John F. Slater Fund. His broad
liberality, his intimate knowledge of the Southern field, and
his honest impartiality make him just the man for that place. We
anticipate a most effective administration of the Slater Fund under
his care. Another event in the history of the Methodist Episcopal
Church South was the inauguration, in May last, at the General
Conference, of a plan for founding a school of high grade for the
training of teachers and preachers among the colored people. A new
and crowning impulse to this was given at the recent meeting of the
North Georgia Conference, in the appointment of Dr. Morgan Galloway
as the President of the new institution, which is to be located in
Augusta, Ga., and named “Paine College.” All honor to our Southern
Methodist friends for these movements in so important a matter, and
all success to them in these and every other like endeavor, which
their hearts may prompt them to plan and their hands to execute.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Revivals How and When</span>, is the title of a very timely and
useful volume by Rev. Wm. W. Newell, D.D. The following subjects
with others are discussed: Why use the word revival, Evangelistic
meetings, Household revivals, Bible class and Sabbath-school
revivals, Revival preaching, Fixed laws for the promotion of
revivals, Temperance revivals, When should we have revivals. Dr.
Newell speaks from a rich experience of many years and enforces
his views with copious incidents and pertinent quotations from the
words of eminent men. The whole subject is discussed in a clear,
comprehensive and interesting manner. The book was prepared to
help ministers and laymen, and contains an abundance of suggestive
and available information. There is no work more dear to this
Association than revival work, and no volume has recently come to
our knowledge apparently more fitted to promote it.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>WOMAN’S OPPORTUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE AGE.</h3>

<p>There is nothing like it in any land—the opportunity of the
Christian women of America to labor for the uplift of womanhood the
world over. The call, however, for woman’s work in America during
the past twenty years seems to us to have been peculiarly urgent,
and yet we think the majority of the noble Christian women in our
churches have, up to this time, seen only dimly the demands upon
them in this regard. How loving, pitying woman, whose labors and
sacrifices are so abounding in behalf of women, should have seen
with so little responsive interest the necessities for work among
the colored women of this land, is among the marvels of Christian
ethics.</p>

<p>If women, anywhere, are under obligation to help women, it seems to
us the women in our churches are indebted, beyond words to tell,
to the negro women in the South. Their condition is what we have
<em>made</em> it, and remains what we <em>will</em> it.</p>

<p>But let us not convey the impression that Christian women have been
wholly indifferent to the wants of their colored sisters. On the
other hand, we affirm that there is not a brighter page in modern
missions, than that which records the labors and sacrifices of
Northern women for the lowly dwellers in the cabins of the South.
We only speak, comparatively, of the great body, who need to be
stirred and mastered, as have been the few who have hurried with
the medicine of light and love to relieve the stricken and the
despairing. These have sacrificed youth and beauty, and the hope of
family love and joy, in the attempt to serve a race. With a calm
and reverent step they have gone into the darkest homes of poverty
and suffering to clothe the naked, to minister to the sick, to
comfort the dying, and to save the perishing.</p>

<p>Twenty-one years ago, when this Association called for teachers
and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a> missionaries to submit to reproach, and obloquy, and ostracism
for the sake of these needy ones, these <em>rare</em> women, in numbers
beyond our ability to send, answered the call. And during all the
years they have stood at our doors, as they stand to-day, saying
“Send me.”</p>

<p>The work they have done in school building, in church building,
in home building and in character building, cannot be matched in
the history of this generation, certainly, and probably not in the
history of the world.</p>

<p>When it is remembered, that in 1863 the slaves in the South did not
own an acre of ground and had not a cent of taxable property—that
they had no right to know a letter of the alphabet, and that there
was not a legal marriage among them: but that in 1880 they were
taxed for a hundred millions of dollars—that some 800,000 of them
had learned to read, and that purer churches were teaching purer
and better morals, one can but exclaim, “What hath God wrought!”</p>

<p>This is, largely, due to the Christian teachers and missionaries of
the American Missionary Association. No society has sent so many
of them to the field, or has so signally demonstrated the quality
and the value of their work. If the history of many of the most
promising and useful of our graduates could be written up the story
would read like romance.</p>

<p>The draught upon mind, and heart, and body has been heavy and
exhausting. Not a few have left the service broken in health for
life, and others have paid the penalty of overwork in early graves.
All this they have not complained of; but their keenest anguish has
come from lack of that fullness and warmness of sympathy which they
had a right to expect from the whole Christian sisterhood of the
North. They ask for it now, and we ask for it in their name!</p>

<p>Will not our Christian women re-examine this question of their duty
with reference to the elevation of the colored race, and especially
of the women of that race? There can be no sure and lasting
elevation of that people without refined and intelligent homes; and
there can be no such homes without pure and intelligent colored
women to build them. Such women can be brought forward, only as
they have pure models to imitate, and refined teachers to instruct
and guide them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Northern homes are full of such models and of such
teachers; and they only need the supporting word and hand of their
sisters to go forth in larger numbers, and to lay, more broadly and
grandly, the foundations of a regenerated South. They <em>know</em> that
the colored woman can be elevated by the gospel of Christ, they
<em>know</em> that she can take on culture like a garment, and be made a
power in redeeming her race.</p>

<p>May we not, then, once more call the attention of Christian women
to this work, so peculiarly theirs, and laid upon them by so many
providential tokens?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></p>

<p>It will be of interest to a large circle of friends on both sides
of the water to learn of the marriage at Prof. Geo. L. White’s
residence, Fredonia, N.Y., of Miss Ella Sheppard, pianist of the
original Jubilee Singer Company, to Rev. Geo. W. Moore, of Oberlin.
Mr. Moore is a graduate of Fisk University and acted as pastor of
the Howard Chapel at Nashville for some time, where his labors
were much appreciated. He has recently been connected with the
theological department of Oberlin College and has preached with
acceptance to churches in Ohio.</p>

<h3 title="FINANCIAL">A FALLING OFF OF 17 PER CENT. IN DONATIONS FROM THE LIVING.</h3>

<p>The receipts from living donors for the first three months of our
fiscal year amounted to $39,528.77, against $48,174.97 for the
corresponding months of the previous year, showing a falling off
of more than 17 per cent. The receipts from legacies, however,
amounted to $15,486.65, against $7,029.65 of the year before. The
total receipts for the three months ending Dec. 31st amounted to
$55,015.42, against $55,204.62 for the previous year.</p>

<p>The Committee on Finance at Cleveland estimated that for this
year $375,000 would be wanted, against $300,000 for the year then
closed, an increase of 25 per cent. If this gain had been realized,
we should have received for the first quarter $93,750 instead
of $55,015.42, a difference of $38,734.58. The friends of this
Association will see from these figures that if the plans suggested
at our Annual Meeting are carried out, not only must the smaller
sources of contributions be augmented, but the churches having the
means to give must contribute more largely. With this in view we
take the liberty of making the following suggestions:</p>

<p>1. That in localities where money is raised by solicitation from
a few old friends who have already taken a deep interest in the
Negroes, efforts for collecting funds be made immediately.</p>

<p>2. In parishes where the benevolent organizations connected with
the church give no assistance to the Freedmen, we suggest that
special efforts be made in Sabbath-schools, the monthly concert
and at the annual collection, so that the amount raised for this
Association may be in due proportion to that given to the other
missionary societies supported by the Congregational churches.</p>

<p>3. In churches that do not follow a fixed system as to time for
taking collections, we suggest that the claims of our work be
explained and urged at least once a year, and that contributions be
forwarded to us at the earliest date possible.</p>

<p>We commend these suggestions to that thoughtful and prayerful
consideration which we believe is justified and demanded by the
necessities of the great work in which we are engaged.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AND NATIONAL ILLITERACY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PROF. C.&nbsp;C. PAINTER.</p>

<p>Broad questions of Statesmen receive tardy attention from the
average legislator because they receive but little from his
constituents, while such matters as the imposition or removal of a
tax upon cigars is to him of pressing interest, because it concerns
the “boys” who run the caucases. This is perhaps well, as questions
of policy are tentatively settled and affect only passing and
limited interests; issues that are fundamental and vital, which are
to be settled for all time, come to a full recognition slowly.</p>

<p>Statutes are enacted as average intellects may decide, or the
balance of selfishness allow, but laws are not made, but discovered
as God has enacted, and related them to permanent interests. The
making or unmaking of the one is the facile work of charlatans
when by some mysterious providence they find their way into our
legislative halls; the discovery of the other is work for seers and
statesmen which once done is done forever.</p>

<p>The Revised Statutes of this Congress make obsolete those of the
last, not necessarily because superior wisdom has devised better,
which must prove a permanent gain; but when a law of human society
has been recognized and so enunciated that it becomes a regulating
force, civilization has taken a forward step. The race is not
simply less disturbed and more comfortable because temporary
adjustments have been made of conflicting interests, but it is
richer and stronger because of an enduring possession, and we can
afford to labor and wait for such.</p>

<p>Each new application of an old principle calls for a fresh
statement of the principle. That man’s personal rights are
modified by the fact of his social relations, is a truth old as
the beginning of civilized life, but that he may not suffer his
children to grow up in ignorance, is a proposition startling to
many, and practically asserted by but few of our State governments,
though it is well-known that our government itself as well as all
our social interests are put in jeopardy by the ignorant citizen
who becomes a voter.</p>

<p>That the constitutional duty of the President to execute the laws,
and of Congress to provide for the safety of the Republic involved
the right to levy war against states, to blockade their harbors, to
emancipate their slaves, to dictate the Constitutions under which
they could resume their autonomy as States in the union, this was
recognized only in face of fearful dangers and admitted only when
established on many bloody fields of a desolating war, but is now
so familiar, so axiomatic that no one doubts the nation’s right to
defend its own life by all means which do not of themselves subvert
that life.</p>

<p>That the safety of the Republic requires a general diffusion of
intelligence<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a> no sane man will deny, and yet some assert that it
will subvert the fundamental principles of this government if it
practically secured this prime condition of its own life—that it
must delegate to other hands the control of conditions and facts
vital to its life, with no power or right to enforce attention to
them. The right and capacity of self-government are found only
in the virtue and intelligence of the people. If this be so, the
obligation of a free government to enforce the education of its
citizens is involved in its right to live.</p>

<p>This obligation is recognized, or should be, in the constitutional
guarantee of a Republican form of government to each State, for
the guarantee of such a form of government carries with it the
conditions essential to it, one of which, and a prime one, is the
intelligence of the citizen. This cannot be secured by the military
arm of the nation, but by the school-master alone, who thus becomes
a constitutional officer of the republic. The proposition that a
republican form of government may be maintained by force over a
people too ignorant to maintain it for themselves is too absurd for
serious debate.</p>

<p>The right of the national government to interfere in case a State
neglects the education of its children, seems clear on the ground
of self-protection. The duty to aid the States struggling to
accomplish this work, but unable to do it, because of its vastness,
and of its own poverty, seems also clear, and has now become urgent
in view of the appalling facts revealed in the last census.</p>

<p>Our national Congress is constrained to hear the cry that is coming
up from all parts of the country calling attention to this duty.
Let not those who feel an interest in this, relax effort or lose
heart. It is not a measure to be adopted in a moment. It means
much; it involves much. It will bring with it new and seemingly
revolutionary conceptions of the functions of the government when
it reaches out its strong arms to defend its life, not in the sad
work of shooting down ignorant and brutalized parricides, but in
the better work of helping to qualify for their children, who are
to be charged with duties, the gravest which fall to men, and for
positions the highest to which ambition can impel them—the duties
and position of a citizen of this free republic.</p>

<p>John R. Buchtel has sold $200,000 worth of stock in the Buckeye
Works to Lewis Miller and his three sons, in order to make an
additional gift of $100,000 to Buchtel College.</p>

<p>James McLaren, a brother of Professor McLaren, of Toronto, Canada,

<p>The gift of $10,000 from the late Tracy R. Edson, which his
trustees are now ready to pay, to the General Theological Seminary
for “The Tracy R. Edson Foundation,” makes over $160,000 received
by the Seminary in the last three years. The interest of Mr.
Edson’s gift is to be used in instructing students in the church
service.</p>

<p><em>The number of persons over ten years of age among the colored
people who could not write, in the sixteen old slave states,
according to the census report of November, 1882, was upwards of
three millions; the number of native-born whites who were equally
illiterate was upwards of one and a half millions. We believe there
is no more imperative necessity than endowments for educational
institutions sustained for the purpose of ridding the country of
this illiteracy.</em></p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, Texas.—Rev. Byron Gunner is about to make his
paper “The Informer” a weekly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence</span>, Ala.—Rev. S.&nbsp;G. Norcross, of North Conway,
N.H., desiring to spend five months in the South, is to take the
place of the lamented pastor, Rev. W.&nbsp;H. Ash, and Mrs. Norcross
will have charge of the school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>, La.—In the Central Church, (Dr. Alexander’s)
a series of meetings held by the pastor, has resulted in some
thirty hopeful conversions. A friend from the North, who fell in
upon them, reports a quiet and deeply impressive service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span>, Texas.—Pastor Mitchell Thompson rejoices with his
people in a revival of unusual seriousness and spirituality. Eight
or ten persons were joined to the company of believers. That the
people should attend through freezing weather was a thing almost
unknown before. They commonly hold such meetings in midsummer. The
church has been painted, the pastor doing the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soddy</span>, Tenn.—At the recent meeting of the Central South
Conference at Florence, Rev. W.&nbsp;H. Thomas and his Welsh Church at
Soddy were received, upon application, into the fellowship of the
body. Rev. Robert D. Thomas, of the Welsh Church at Knoxville, has
been a member for some time. He is now retiring from his charge and
a pastor will be sought who can preach in English a part of the
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atlanta, Ga.</span>—Miss Ella W. Moore, a teacher in the Atlanta
University, has, by the special aid of friends, been able to
employ a teacher in a private school opened under her auspices. In
addition to the receipts in money, she has recently received (for
which she makes grateful acknowledgment) from Mrs. John B. Gough,
Worcester, Mass., patchwork, pictures, cards, tracts, etc.; from
Mrs. J.&nbsp;B. Shaw, Paxton, Ill., and Miss Amy Blatchford, Chicago,
valuable Sabbath-school papers and periodicals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meridian</span>, Miss.—By a council on the 15th of Dec., Mr.
J.&nbsp;L. Grice, a graduate of the college and theological department
in Howard University, a member of Dr. J.&nbsp;E. Rankin’s church, was
ordained as pastor after a most satisfactory examination. Sermon
and right-hand of fellowship, by Superintendent Roy; charge to
the candidate, by Rev. E.&nbsp;C. Stickel; address to the church, by
Rev. C.&nbsp;B. Curtis; and prayer of ordination, by Bishop Turner of
the African M.&nbsp;E. Church, the members of the council joining him
in laying on of hands. As the Bishop was holding a Conference in
the city, he attended both the afternoon and evening services of
the Council, after the members of that body had waited upon the
Conference in the morning. The Bishop stated that in attending a
great many examinations, he had never come upon a better one.</p>

<h3 title="EDUCATIONAL WORK FOR FREEDMEN">RESUMÉ OF EDUCATIONAL WORK BY BENEVOLENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR FREEDMEN.</h3>

<p class="secauth">EXTRACT FROM AN ARTICLE OF SECRETARY STRIEBY IN THE FORTHCOMING
VOLUME OF THE SCHAFF-HERZOG ENCYCLOPÆDIA OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE.</p>

<h4>WORK OF A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</h4>

<p>The first school for the Freedmen was established by the American
Missionary Association. On the 17th of September, 1861, only five
months after the beginning of the war, that school was opened at
Hampton, Va., where many fugitive slaves had congregated under the
protection of the guns of Fortress Monroe. The spot overlooked
the waters on which the first slave ship entered the American
Continent. The Association steadily extended its work, until
it had founded chartered institutions in every large Southern
State;—Berea College, Berea, Ky.; Hampton Institute, Hampton,
Va.; Atlanta University, Atlanta, Ga.; Fisk University, Nashville,
Tenn.; Talladega College, Talladega, Ala.; Tougaloo University,
Tougaloo, Miss.; Straight University, New Orleans, La.; Tillotson
Collegiate and Normal Institute, Austin, Texas. Land has also been
purchased for the Edward Smith College, in Little Rock, Arkansas.
It has 49 other schools of different grades. Connected with some
of its chartered institutions are Theological, Law and Industrial
Departments. Those at Hampton, Talladega and Tougaloo, have large
farms. Chartered Institutions, 8; Normal and High Schools, 11;
Common Schools, 38; Total, 57; Teachers, 241; Students, 9,608.
Howard University, Washington, D.C., established by the Freedmen’s
Bureau, in 1882 had 29 teachers and 349 students. The theological
department is sustained mainly by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>FREEDMEN’S AID SOCIETIES.</h4>

<p>The “Freedmen’s Aid Societies” were early organized. The first
was formed in Boston, Feb. 7th, a second in New York, Feb. 23d,
1863. Others followed rapidly—in Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland,
and elsewhere throughout the North, and in 1865 the teachers
employed by all the societies numbered 634. With a view to economy
and efficiency they were consolidated in 1866, in the “American
Freedmen’s Union Commission.” These societies devoted themselves
in large part at first to physical relief and the organization
of labor. But ere long, the education of the Freedmen became
their chief endeavor and they accomplished much good in the line
of secular education. But the several branches were at length
abandoned or became absorbed in the societies of the religious
organizations. The Commission itself closed in 1869.</p>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE BAPTISTS.</h4>

<p>The Baptists, who conduct their work, both educational and church,
among the Freedmen, through their Home Missionary Society, entered
early into the establishment of schools; beginning in the Spring of
1862 with schools at St. Helena and Beaufort, S.C., and afterwards
adding others at Fortress Monroe, Washington, Knoxville and New
Orleans. Missionaries were appointed to preach, and to teach
day-schools, and assistants, both male and female, were sent out;
from 3,000 to 5,000 pupils were taught yearly, until about 1872,
when the secular or day-school system was given up, and efforts
concentrated on permanent or higher institutions, some of which
had been planted in 1865. In 1882, the Society has under its
care 12 schools as follows: Wayland Seminary, Washington, D.C.;
Richmond Institute, Richmond, Va.; Shaw University, Raleigh, N.C.;
Benedict Institute, Columbia, S.C.; Atlanta Seminary, Atlanta,
Ga.; Nashville Institute, Nashville, Tenn.; Leland University, New
Orleans, La.; Natchez Seminary, Natchez, Miss.; Alabama Normal
and Theological School at Selma, Ala.; Florida Institute, Live
Oak, Fla.; Bishop College, Marshall, Tex.; Louisville Normal and
Theological School, Louisville, Kentucky. Normal instruction is
given in most of the schools; industrial education in several; and
Biblical instruction in all. In four institutions a collegiate
course is pursued. Five are chartered institutions. In 1882,
Schools, 12; Teachers, 79; Pupils, 2,397. The Free Will Baptists
have an excellent institution, Storer College, at Harper’s Ferry,
W. Va., with 5 Teachers and 245 Students.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE FRIENDS.</h4>

<p>The Friends, true to the principles of the founder of their
denomination, George Fox, entered at once the opened door for
relieving the physical necessities of the Freedmen, and at length
established schools among them; but when the public schools
furnished the education, they gradually withdrew. They now maintain
Southland College, Helena, Ark., with 277 Pupils, a school in
Maryville, Tenn., with 13 Instructors and 211 Pupils, and one in
Philadelphia with 291 Pupils, with the supervision of 22 other
schools in the South sustained for several months in the year. The
Friends (Hicksite), entered the work in 1862, furnishing supplies
at first, afterwards sustaining schools numbering at one time 25.
They now have one school with 150 scholars.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.</h4>

<p>The Methodist Episcopal Church had from the first co-operated with
the undenominational Aid Societies in the care of the Freedmen, in
relieving physical suffering and in giving instruction in primary
education. But it concentrated its efforts by the organization, in
Cincinnati, Aug. 6, 1866, of “The Freedmen’s Aid Society of the
Methodist Episcopal Church.” This Society now reports six chartered
institutions, viz.: Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tenn.;
Clark University, Atlanta, Ga.; Claflin University, Orangeburg,
S.C.; New Orleans University, New Orleans, La.; Rust University,
Holly Springs, Miss.; Wiley University, Marshall, Texas. Four
theological schools, viz.: Centenary Biblical Institute, Baltimore,
Md.; Gammon Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Ga.; Baker Institute,
Orangeburg, S.C., and Thomson Biblical Institute, New Orleans, La.
One medical college, viz., Meharry Medical College, Nashville,
Tenn.; and 14 institutions not chartered. Total number of
institutions, 35; teachers, 95; pupils, 3,506. It gives special
attention to Biblical instruction, and at Clark University a
Department of Industry is established. The African Methodist
Episcopal Church founded and sustained Wilberforce University at
Xenia, Ohio, with 13 teachers and 170 students.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE PRESBYTERIANS.</h4>

<p>The “Presbyterian Committee of Missions for Freedmen,” was
organized by the General Assembly in 1865 and began its work
at once, by sending preachers and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a> teachers to the South. Its
efforts thus far are confined to the two Carolinas, Virginia and
Tennessee, with a few missions and schools in Georgia, Kentucky
and Florida. It has under its care three chartered institutions:
Biddle University, Charlotte, N.C. (with a Theological
Department), Wallingford Academy, Charleston, S.C., and Scotia
Seminary, Concord, N.C.; 2 normal schools; 3 graded schools, and
50 parochial schools. Total number of schools, 58; teachers,
108; scholars, 6,088. Lincoln University (Lincoln University P.
O.), Oxford, Pa., has an able corps of 13 professors and 200
students—18 theological, 100 collegiate, 82 preparatory. The
United Presbyterians have two schools, one in Abbyville, Va., with
4 teachers and 245 students, the other in Chase City, Va., with 3
teachers and 251 students.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE EPISCOPALIANS.</h4>

<p>The “Protestant Episcopal Freedmen’s Commission” was organized
October, 1865, and in a few months it opened schools in Petersburg,
Va., Wilmington and Raleigh, N.C. The first year the teachers
numbered 23, and the scholars, day and night, 1,600. The Committee
for Domestic Missions (under whose care this work now is), reported
in 1882, 2 normal schools with 8 teachers each, and 11 schools with
one teacher each. The normal schools are at Raleigh, N.C., and at
Petersburg, Va.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE ROMAN CATHOLICS.</h4>

<p>The Catholic Directory for 1882 reports for the Archdiocese of
Baltimore 1 academy for colored girls, with 60 pupils, and 4 other
schools with 693 pupils; total, 753; Archdiocese of New Orleans,
7 schools, 330 pupils; Archdiocese of St. Louis, 1 school, 120
pupils; Diocese of Louisville, 6 schools, 332 pupils; Diocese of
Natchez, 3 schools, 80 pupils; Diocese of Natchitoches, 2 schools,

<h3>THE HEMENWAY FARM.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY GEN. S.&nbsp;C. ARMSTRONG.</p>

<p>In 1878, when the 150 acres of arable land of the Hampton Institute
could offer no more farm work to the increasing number of negro
and Indian students, a generous lady, of Boston, Mass., gave,
principally for the benefit of the Indians, the sum of nine
thousand dollars, to purchase a fine grass and grain farm of 350
acres, five miles from the school, to which was added, by purchase,
250 acres more, and to it has been given the name “Hemenway Farm,”
as a memorial to the husband of the giver.</p>

<p>It was placed in charge of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. H. Vanison, both
graduates of Hampton, but has been under the general control of Mr.
Albert Howe, formerly of Dorchester, Mass., manager of the Normal
School farm.</p>

<p>During the three and a half summer (vacation) months, the sixty
Indian boys, excepting about one-third who go to Berkshire Co.,
Mass., to work with the farmers, spend by turns, in squads of
twelve or fifteen, two weeks at a time at this farm, taking part
in the stock and farming operations, which are carried on on
a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a> larger and simpler scale than at the school. They thus get
a wholesome change from life in the workshops, besides useful,
practical knowledge. A general knowledge of agriculture and stock
is important for those who are learning trades.</p>

<p>The steady working force of the farm is composed of from eight to
ten colored boys, who begin October 1st each year, working till the
next October, ten hours a day, studying every night from seven till
nine o’clock, under the direction of Mrs. Vanison. They receive,
besides their board, from $8 to $10 a month, which, excepting $3 a
month for clothing, they are expected to save to pay future school
expenses. They are an ignorant, destitute class, but, as a rule,
are most willing, earnest and deserving students. After working all
day, they study harder at night than any others in the school. Ten
hours of handling lumber at the saw-mill, or steady work on the
farm, or in the machine shop, is no trifling duty, but they are
eager for their night lessons.</p>

<p>The ten at the Hemenway Farm are a part of 130 “work students,”
thirty of them girls, employed in the various industrial
departments, constituting about one-third of the colored pupils
at Hampton. They devote a preliminary year to day labor and night
study, to fit themselves to enter the junior class of this year’s
course, and to accumulate a small fund, averaging $75 for the year,
to help meet cost of board, ten dollars a month, besides clothing
and books. This is done in part by working two days each week of
the regular course. With strict economy and working all vacations,
they maintain themselves through the entire course graduating
without receiving a dollar in charity, some, however, need help the
last year and none are more worthy of it.</p>

<p>The effect on their characters is excellent. Good as it is, that
they shall earn and learn in this way, it is even better for the
habits, ideas and manliness it promotes. The entire class is
mature, averaging 19 years of age. Mr. Vanison is as excellent a
manager as we care to have; his wife keeps house, sees to the boys’
meals, rooms and washing, and teaches them nights, besides raising
some 500 chickens, at which she has a wonderful “knack.”</p>

<p>The farm was cultivated last year as follows; 75 acres in wheat,
80 acres in oats, 112 in corn, 35 in clover and orchard grass,
the rest in pasture, a few acres being devoted to vegetables and
an orchard. Much was done in clearing old ditch banks. The stock
consists of 50 hogs and pigs, 110 sheep and lambs, 6 colts, and
from 10 to 20 beef cattle, which are <a id="Err1" name="Err1"></a>bought in the neighborhood,
fattened on the pasture and killed at the school, two or three a
week being required there.</p>

<p>The Hemenway farm, of 600 acres, some 60 acres of it marshy, is
situated in Elizabeth City County, on Bach River, which is an
estuary half a mile in width. The house is a famous, but plain,
old Southern mansion, in which Gen. Washington once dined. Until
1878 it had been for many generations in the hands of an old
aristocratic family, whom the war impoverished, and their place
was sold for debt. The location is a beautiful one; the region is
quite Englishlike in appearance, with its rich, level fields and
its hedge-rows. In summer, delicious breezes blow up the river from
Chesapeake Bay, four miles distant.</p>

<p>Oysters and fish abound in its water front; a handsome lawn and
fine old trees surround the house, all of which are a delight to
the boys, especially to the Indians, who have long summer mornings.</p>

<p>The past season a plain but pretty cottage was added to the old
house, which was too small, containing a dining-room, kitchen,
laundry, and bedrooms for the boys upstairs. This leaves rooms, as
was intended by the giver, for tired teachers to come and rest for
a night from the cares and din of the institute, to whom the quiet
and beauty of “Shellbanks,” its former name, is a great comfort.
I must not forget to mention the ample barn, stable, cow-shed,
tool-house, corn-crib, extensive stacks of straw, and wind-mill for
pumping water for the stock.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></p>

<p>This is entirely a negro affair; no white person lives on the
place. Its Christian character and influence are earnest and
emphatic. Nothing in the Hampton system is more satisfactory
than this farm. I hope others like it will be provided for other
institutions, but to fit up an old Southern farm after buying it,
costs about as much as the land costs.</p>

<p>An unexpected advantage of the farm is its being an excellent place
for a badly-behaved Indian boy, when only one is sent there. He
is punished by being separated from his old friends, but the ten
colored fellows carry him along in their daily routine of work and
study; he has no one to “cut up” with; he improves in spite of
himself; the plan has never failed to work well; he finally likes
it and returns changed for the better.</p>

<h3>REVIVAL IN CENTRAL CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">W.&nbsp;S. ALEXANDER, D.D.</p>

<p>It has been our custom in previous years to begin our special
religious meetings the first of January in connection with the
“Week of Prayer.” But this year the Church seemed in readiness at
an earlier date, and we felt that we were obeying the call of the
Lord to “go forward” when we began our special effort to reach the
impenitent, on the night of December 1st. The Friday preceding had
been observed as a day of fasting and prayer. For many days the
spirit of prayer and consecration had been evidently deepening upon
the part of the great majority of the Lord’s people. People who,
for some trivial reason, had been alienated, came together in the
spirit of forgiveness. A great desire was expressed, and I have no
doubt felt, to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord. Our lady
missionary with unsurpassed devotion, visited all the families of
the congregation, making in the short space of ten weeks some 600
visits. The effort was made to reach every one who sustained even
a nominal relation to our church, as a member or casual attendant,
and invite him to our revival services.</p>

<p>The result was all and more than we anticipated. The church was
thronged every night. The very first night several presented
themselves for prayer. The number of inquirers increased till we
counted more than fifty. One by one, with a quietness and depth
of feeling that impressed every heart, these earnest inquirers
came into the light, and were made to “rejoice in hope of the
glory of God.” The two manly and dearly beloved sons of the Dean
of our Faculty, were among the first to share in the blessings of
the revival. God only knows our joy when they came forward with
the rest, and bowed before God as suppliants for His mercy and
forgiveness. Never did the words of Holy Writ, which have fallen
from the lips of so many believers, sound sweeter than when one of
these young men recited as his verse at the breakfast table, the
morning after his conversion, “I know that my Redeemer liveth.”</p>

<p>A pleasant and somewhat unusual feature of this revival has been
its influence upon the men. On more than one occasion we counted
twelve men on the “Mourners’ seats.” Thirty-four professed
conversion. We hope and believe they have been “born again.” A
class of 35 are waiting in joyful anticipation of taking the vows
of God upon them in the Church, and of receiving their “first
communion.”</p>

<p>I should do injustice to my own feelings did I not speak of the
earnest sympathy and hearty co-operation of all the teachers in the
University in this religious movement. We moved in this matter as a
united body, with but one object in view: the glory of God, and the
upbuilding of the Kingdom of His Son.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h3>ADDITIONAL REPORT OF THE REVIVAL.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PROF. R.&nbsp;C. HITCHCOCK.</p>

<p>The revival which has been in progress for several weeks at Central
Church has been to me a constant wonder. Even in sedate old
Connecticut a revival season is usually a scene of much emotional
excitement, and it is often impossible to tell how much is sincere
and permanent; but this revival has been all through marked by a
quiet, deep and reverential character. It was my first opportunity
for observation of such meetings among the colored people. I had
heard and read a great deal of the tumultuous excitement on such
occasions, and each night I looked to see, when they should be
fairly “warmed up,” such scenes as I had had pictured. What I
actually did see was this. Each night the pastor preached a short,
practical gospel sermon, packed full with reasons why religion
should be chosen and chosen now, to an earnest, attentive audience.
Then he stepped down in front, and in kind but strong words invited
all who felt the truth of what had been said and wished to become
Christians, to come forward for conversation and the prayers of
the church. Most of those who accepted the invitation were men of
middle age and young men; a few were young ladies.</p>

<p>Night after night this went on; while the pastor and others were
talking with those who came forward, the audience engaged in
singing. No general invitation was given to speak or pray, a few
only being called on each night to take part. Each night some
souls found peace and joy. It was my good fortune to talk with
nearly every one of the converts, and I found all, so far as I
could judge, thoroughly in earnest; no one scared or urged into
confessions, but each, as the new hope was born in his soul,
rising, generally with streaming eyes, to tell what God had done
for him and ask for fellowship and prayerful help.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL AND CHURCH WORK AT FAYETTEVILLE, ARK.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. B.&nbsp;F. FOSTER.</p>

<p>We began work here on the 5th of September, and opened school
under very favorable auspices. We have had 92 pupils enrolled.
Our school is the only one for colored children within a radius
of 65 miles. We are giving some attention to church work, and are
using our school-house as a place of worship. We have service
every Sabbath morning at eleven o’clock—the audiences are
large. We are gratified to say that the influence of the teachers
takes fast hold upon both parent and pupil. We have Sunday-school
every afternoon at three o’clock, and these services are largely
attended. Thanksgiving day was appropriately commemorated. A
sermon was preached in the morning by the missionary pastor. All
who were present seemed deeply impressed with the word. The chapel
was beautifully and tastefully festooned with autumn leaves and
berries, and the walls were embellished with appropriate mottoes
of the sacred Scriptures. At seven o’clock in the evening a very
large number of patrons and friends of the school gathered, and
partook of a repast prepared as a thanksgiving token for them by
the teachers and pupils. Toasts were responded to by the several
pastors of the town and teachers. I said we had service in our
chapel at 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> every Sunday. We could induce as many
to come in the evening if we had lamps to light up our chapel.
Equally as good results would come from a weekly prayer-meeting, if
we had sufficient lights. We heartily accept this opportunity of
asking the friends of some of our Northern churches to give us of
their old ones—chandelier lamps. The Lord’s Supper was celebrated
the first time, since beginning our work here, last Sunday. Truly,
the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a> Lord was with his people on that solemn occasion. At this
service the missionary pastor’s first and only little daughter was
baptized, which increased the interest of the meeting. To carry
this blessed Supper to Christ’s brethren and sisters, Mrs. Foster’s
pie-pans were used for the emblems of his body, and two borrowed
mugs for the emblem of his blood. From this the friends of God’s
poor will see we would thank them very much to assist us in getting
a communion set. The people among whom we are working are very
poor. Few of them have homes.</p>

<h3>MISSION WORK—GOOD RESULTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sacramento Mission.</span>—Mrs. Rilla Carrington, who for the
last three years has most faithfully and successfully conducted the
Sacramento Mission, is required by the state of her health to take
a vacation. It will be only a vacation, and I hope and expect that
two or three months of recuperation will bring her back fresh and
strong, and good for another three years of steady and faithful
service. During her absence, her sister will take her place, and
will fill it well. In communicating her desire for this respite,
she indulges in some reminiscences which, I am sure, will interest
our readers. “During the past three years and a quarter, more than
450 have, for a longer or shorter period, been members of our
Sacramento school. I would that all who come with us in the school
could remain until they are converted and ready to work for the
salvation of their people. We know of the good service of many who
have gone out from us to visit their homes. For instance, Fong Get
Roy, who wrote you something of his work while in China: he has
not ceased to labor for Christ since his return; Fong Gee, whose
father, now dead, was a heathen priest, was always zealous while
here with us; sometimes speaking to his country-men for an hour or
more at a time, showing them, in the most ridiculous light, the
folly of idol and ancestral worship, and holding up Christ as the
only hope of salvation. His health gave out, and he was compelled
to return to China—being helped by the brethren of San Francisco
and Sacramento to do so. There he is working at his trade for a
mere pittance, and giving what time he can for the conversion of
his country-men. Wong Loung visited his home a year ago, and was
married, in accordance with Chinese customs, to one to whom he
had been betrothed in childhood by his parents. Because he had
renounced the religion of his fathers, he suffered much indignity
from members of his family—the persecutions becoming so great he
was obliged to leave home. But the result was that he returned to
America more determined than ever to hold fast to Christ. Louis
Sing, too, was under great pressure while in China to take part in
worship with his relations, but could not, he said, because he knew
the uselessness of such worship. We hear of Gwan Lee, our organist,
as standing firm amidst the powers of darkness—holding fast to the
living faith. He is one of those whom the present law prohibits
from returning to this country. We all feel as though we could not
give him up, and that some way must be found by which he may come
back.</p>

<p>“We are not only made glad by work done far away, but workers are
here with us—true hearts that love to do something for Jesus
every day. Several have joined the Association this year; among
them, Fong Bow, who is one of the class for whom I requested your
prayers several months ago. He seemed to have much to hold him
back; outside influence made it hard for him to decide. He has
been <a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a>a member of the school so long that we feel more than usually
happy in his coming. May we not hope and still pray, in faith, for
the other members of the class? This mission work is ever a source
of comfort and pleasure to me, and I know I cannot remain away from
it if blessed with health.”</p>

<h3>LOU QUONG, ON HEATHEN PRAYERS AND REAL PRAYER.</h3>

<p>Each Wednesday afternoon I meet the Chinese helpers in the schools
of this city for a drill in Bible study, and to receive and remark
upon the sketches of sermons, which they have prepared during the
week. Here is one which Lou Quong brought in yesterday. James 5:16.</p>

<p>“The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”</p>

<p>My subject is all on prayer to-day, and it is very needful to all
Christians, especially to those who really mean to be the followers
of the Lord Jesus, and to be workers in the Master’s field. I
will mention a few things of the heathen prayers, which were
occasionally offered to the heathen gods in China as well as in
this city. So far as I can judge there is no true prayer which was
ever offered to their gods, and I, having been born in a heathen
nation, therefore know them well. Each certain prayer belongs to a
certain god. You cannot take one god’s prayer to pray to others; if
you do, you will get no blessing, because you got the wrong prayer,
their prayers not having to come from the heart, but being learned
only from the history of a certain god, so they mostly repeat the
words as near as they can remember. There is not a single prayer
that really comes from the heart. They come only from the lips;
and besides this, when they pray, they do not, like our Christian
people, pray for bad and good, and even for our enemies, and for
all nations; their prayers are only for a certain thing, a certain
matter, for riches, for honors, and for glory, and to have more
sons born than girls; for their father and mother, brothers and
sisters, that they might have a long life. If they have any one
which they do not like, they would pray their God to destroy his
whole family. By this we know that such a prayer our true God will
not hear, but rather punish them. I have a great deal more to say
about the heathen prayer, but I have no time for it just now. So I
must go on to the true prayer, which our Lord Jesus Christ taught
his disciples to say. Yet even such a true and short prayer as
that, which we have repeated every evening in our schools, many of
us would forget before we go to bed at night. This won’t do, my
Christian brethren. We must give all our hearts to God before we
shut our eyes. We cannot pray to God for a certain thing that must
be done while our hearts are on something else, or are doubting
whether God could hear us or not. Suppose to-morrow you intend to
go out and look for a place, so you would pray to God to help you
and to give you one, and you believe he will do it, and then when
to-morrow comes you would lie in bed until afternoon. Then you got
up, thinking that was too late, and would not go. This, indeed,
would make you think that God did not hear your prayer last night.
This is the whole trouble that sometimes God don’t answer our
prayer; but I am very sure that God has heard all my prayers and
has answered all which are for good. When we have a certain matter
that we cannot manage at all, and when we would bring it to God, we
must first make our hearts ready to pray and then without doubting
draw out the true thoughts of our hearts and feel that God is above
us and Jesus is on one side. Then comes the Holy Spirit into our
hearts to teach us how to pray. After we got up from prayer I am
sure we can feel that we were heard, and if we are not answered
on a certain hour we must wait and pray without ceasing until it
comes, for God not, like man, would fail you sometime. This is the
kind of prayer that God does hear. So James says, “The effectual,
fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;” that is, God does
always hear and answer the true prayer.</p>

<h3>MISSIONARY MUSIC.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have you ever brought a penny to the missionary box—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A penny which you might have spent like other little folks?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it falls among the rest, have you ever heard a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a pleasant sound of welcome which the other pennies sing?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is missionary music, and it has a pleasant sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pennies make a shilling, and shillings make a pound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many pounds together the gospel news will send,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which tell the distant heathen that the Saviour is their Friend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And oh! what joyous music is the missionary song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it seems to come from every heart and sounds from every tongue—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When happy Christian little ones all sing with one accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the time when realms of darkness shall be kingdoms of the Lord!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But sweeter far than all, which Jesus loves to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are children’s voices when they breathe a missionary prayer—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they bring the heart-petition to the great Redeemer’s throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That He will choose the heathen out, and take them for His own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is the music Jesus taught when he was here below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the music Jesus loves to hear in glory now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a one from, distant lands will reach His heavenly home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In answer to the children’s prayer, “O Lord, Thy kingdom come!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, missionary children, let this music never cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work on, work on in earnest, for the Lord, the Prince of Peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is praying work and paying work for every heart and hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the missionary chorus shall go forth through all the land.<br /></span>

For eleven years there has been published in New York City a
delightful Monthly Magazine, the “Ladies’ Floral Cabinet,” which
treats of FLOWERS for the house and for the garden, as its leading
feature, and with illustrated articles on Ladies’ Fancy Work, Home
and Personal Adornment, Domestic Economy and Practical Suggestions
for the Kitchen, Music, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., in sufficient variety to
commend it to every refined American home. It began its twelfth
year with the January number: The new management has doubled the
number of pages without increasing its price—$1.25 PER YEAR—with
all the cost refunded in ten papers specially grown Flower Seeds,
or Gladiolus Bulbs, as you may select, which go POST FREE to every
yearly subscriber. SEE THE LISTS.

physicians, scientists, and Boards of Health all over the world.</p>

<p class="medium"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The above <span class="smcap">Diagram</span> illustrates the
comparative worth of various Baking Powders, as shown by Chemical
Analysis and experiments made by Professor Schedler. A one pound
can of each powder was taken, the total leavening power or volume
in each can calculated, the result being as indicated in the above
diagram. This practical test for worth by Professor Schedler only
proves what every observant consumer of the Royal Baking Powder
knows by experience, that, while it costs a few cents per pound
more than the ordinary kinds, it is far more economical, and,
besides, affords the advantage of better work.</p>

<p class="medium">A single trial of the Royal Baking Powder will convince any
fair-minded person of these facts.</p>
